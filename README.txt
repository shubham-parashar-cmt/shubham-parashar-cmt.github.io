Pathak Shubham Parashar — Site Upload Bundle
============================================

Files included:
- index.html      (homepage with Research Themes, Selected Work, Experience, Awards, Coursework, Teaching)
- cv.html         (web CV page with Print/Save as PDF button)
- cv.pdf          (printable static CV)
- projects.html   (longer Projects & Code page)
- assets/css/cv.css  (print-optimized CSS used by cv.html)

How to upload (GitHub Pages repo root):
1) Drag-and-drop ALL files/folders from this zip into your repository root:
     shubham-parashar-cmt.github.io/
   Make sure the nested folder path is preserved for assets/css/cv.css.

2) Confirm these paths exist on GitHub after the commit:
     /index.html
     /cv.html
     /cv.pdf
     /projects.html
     /assets/css/cv.css
     /nav-avatar.jpg     (this image should already be in your repo root)

3) Optional cleanup (recommended):
     - Delete duplicate or outdated files like `cv(2).html`.
     - Keep fonts under /assets/fonts only (remove stray root-level `fonts` file/folder).

4) Visit https://shubham-parashar-cmt.github.io and hard refresh (Safari: ⌘⌥R).

If you change where nav-avatar.jpg lives, update the <img src="..."> in index.html and cv.html.
